STATISTICS


Statistics is the study and manipulation of data, including ways to gather, review, analyze, and draw conclusions from data.

now we will discuss about two types of statistics

1) population statistics 
2) sample statistics

population statistics
================================================================
population statistics was divided into two types of means
1)mode
2)median 

same as population statistics , sample statistics also divided into two types 

sample statistics
================================================================
sample statistics was divided into two types of means
1)mode
2)median 


** where here the median and mode are measure of control tendency

3) randam variable
================================================================
1) contiouns variable
2) direcrte variable



population statistics
********************************
let us take a example that our output is that we want to found the average height of all the people in a state for example(AP)
in Ap if we have 1 million people
we want to take all the people height and we need to do average of them

***********************************
** Population Mean (μ) = ∑X / N  **
***********************************

sample statistics
********************************

** now what happens mean that it is vary hard to take that 1 million people heigth so that we take same people height sample that  called sample 

***********************************
**     x̄ = ( Σ xi ) / n.       ****
***********************************

NOTE:
in size 
 
population statistics > sample statistics
 
if the sample size increases more
it may population statistics ~= sample statistics
